# Backlog

* Switch the `dailyReport` from a static layout to a light-weight template system.
* Maybe persist counters; they are currently lost on restart.
* Maybe switch from storing the daily journal in a file, to storing it in a database.
* Eventually make the code more elegant, as I learn more about Pythonâ€¦
